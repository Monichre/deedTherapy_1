                        <h3 class="section-header">Traditional Therapy</h3>
                        <p> Since Freud, the therapeutic community continues to focus on past trauma to explain and address present distress. The times we live in call for recognizing that present experience of both inner and outer phenomena includes indications of the future. Robert Sardello: “That is, what is now increasingly coming about in the world is the possibility to apprehend every moment as our coming-into-being rather than as ‘having’ an identity, which may be threatened by the press of past difficulties.” The rapidly increasing and overwhelming shifts in all areas of this life on earth have produced a plethora of diagnosed and undiagnosed human reactions. Rather than point to the individual soul as disabled and in need of healing, it is a new world coming into being that needs our better care, and we require the finer qualities of a more aware and responsible self to evolve with it. That is why I call my work “deed therapy.”  To varying degrees of awareness, we hear the word of our own and the world’s destiny call for well-intentioned deed to accept and transform suffering into trusting growth.
                        </p>

                        <p>Whether it seems to positively impact your life or negatively disrupt it, your life has immediate potential at this point for significant transformation. Indeed, you have located this site upon searching for some means to perhaps give up smoking, improve your overall health, deal with anxiety, depression, and stress, gain another perspective on a relationship, or respond to an intuition that there’s something more for you and you’re looking for support, encouragement, and direction. Even if certain concerns are not discussed in a session, because of your intention and the comprehensive nature of the practices and exercises taught, positive change occurs.</p>

                                <p>My pursuits of somewhat other realities began in my early twenties with Transcendental Meditation and Anthroposophy (also known as Spiritual Science) as developed by Rudolf Steiner. The Reiki and Bach Flower experiences provided the practical application of healing/transformation techniques to help others.  Hypnotism reminded me that all healing/transformation is self-healing (all hypnosis is self-hypnosis) and the practitioner is a witness, at best a facilitator.</p>

                        <p>The Masters in Mental Health Counseling focused and honed my relational and interviewing skills, but it also essentially confirmed for me what not to do – to label people through a diagnosis. The scientific model systemically entrenched in our culture understandably satisfies the human drive to understand through naming and categorizing. Yet, that perspective can, and indeed has, set severe limits upon human experience, interfering with and short-circuiting processes of growth, decay, and change.   Life issues are reminders that we can responsibly choose to participate in our development.  I understand it to be our human destiny to evolve a spiritualization of substance and, by acknowledging that the matter of our personal business exists by the grace of the universal, we embrace our destiny through a self-willed becoming indeed.</p>


                        <p>Hypnotism reminded me that all healing/transformation is self-healing (all hypnosis is self-hypnosis) and the practitioner is a witness, at best a facilitator. I understand it to be our human destiny to evolve a spiritualization
                            of substance and, by acknowledging that the matter of our personal business exists by the grace of the universal, we activate our destiny through a self-willed becoming indeed.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-header">Bach Flowers</h4>
                        <p>Preparing and distributing the Bach Flower Remedies for over ten years has given me another modality for assisting others. The flower remedies, because they are able to address in combination every possible emotional state, will
                            facilitate healing/transformation throughout all psychological issues: from addictions, anxieties, and depression to relationships. The appropriately selected essences strengthen identified areas of the individual to establish
                            the vital balance that allows for the healing we are all born to experience. The fact that Bach Flower Remedies also give the client something to take home with them as “real” substance provides the extra comforting boost that’s
                            sometimes sought. </p>
                        <p>Dr. Edward Bach worked in London in the early 1900’s as a bacteriologist, pathologist, homeopath, and general practitioner. There were two significant understandings he came to in regard to illness and healing: Individuals respond
                            differently to the same illness and the same treatment; and, the mental and emotional state of the individual affects the illness and the healing. Especially with the latter insight, Dr. Bach was ahead of his time as can be
                            seen now where stress is recognized by the medical establishment as the leading contributor to the majority of diseases, directly impinging on the immune system. With regard to the former, he saw that for healing to occur one
                            must treat the person, not the disease. In 1928, he left his practice in London and moved to the countryside, seeing patients free of charge as he sought in the gentle gesture of plants the corresponding qualities to resonate
                            with the person.</p>
                        <p>With the courage and certainty of a strengthening intuition, he identified 38 ‘high order’ healing plants and developed the most simple and purest method for obtaining the essential energy that is particular and patterned to a
                            plant (a ‘signature’ that has been identified in the laboratory through the process of sensitive crystallization). Each flower essence is then contained in spring water preserved with a minute amount of alcohol. When taken
                            as drops, the individual thus benefits in the most direct, non-intrusive, and natural manner. The flower remedies continue to be collected and prepared in the same location and manner by a few individuals who worked with Dr.
                            Bach’s assistants.</p>
                        <p>The flower essences can be taken as a complement to therapies and medications already being used, as they do not work on a physical level and are completely safe. In a way, they are both before and beyond substance, transferring
                            from the plant to the person the life force that creates, signifies, and sustains. It is recommended that one not take more than seven essences at a time. There is no harm in it; flowers that are not needed will simply have
                            no effect. But there would tend to be a lack of focus, clouding the issues at hand. And, because every individual possesses the characteristics of every flower to varying degrees, it is common to feel that one could choose
                            many at one time. That is where a consultant trained and experienced in both the use of Bach Flower Remedies and Mental Health performs their service.</p>

                        <!-- Hypnosis -->
                        <h4 class="section-header">Hypnosis</h4>

                        <p>It is most common to realize one has habitual thoughts, feeling or actions that you know you must change but simply cannot. For instance, you may want to give up smoking, shed extra pounds, improve your overall health, remove stress,
                            gain new perspective on a relationship, or respond to an intuition that there’s something more for you. You’re looking for support, encouragement and direction. Hypnosis, fully accepted by the American Medical Association in
                            1958 and the American Psychiatric Association in 1962, is a most effective and long-lasting treatment modality.</p>
                        <p>A hypnotist guides you in the most relaxed and natural manner to that newly re-opened part of you, your subconscious, so you can transform habits or access new information to further develop and enhance your life.</p>
                        <p>All hypnosis is self-hypnosis. And, after a session, you can revisit that foundational, source state of your subconscious at your will and pleasure because you will have just learned to experience your own best abilities.</p>
                        <p>Hypnosis does not start or end any place. It is really the ability of a person to accept uncritically their own beliefs. All hypnosis is self-hypnosis. But, the reason you would seek out a consulting hypnotist is because it is
                            a great help to have someone, the hypnotist, facilitate the process, providing objectivity, support, guidance, and feedback.</p>
                        <p>Hypnosis is a state of focused attention during which an individual’s conscious mind is quieted so as to allow the deeper thoughts, feelings, intuitions, and memories of the subconscious mind to rise to the surface. This enables
                            the individual to access new ways of viewing oneself and the world so old habits can be discouraged by choosing to suggest more healthful, productive, and creative actions and ideas to live by.</p>
                        <p> Consider this perspective: the hypnotic state is a very helpful place that everyone not only can but frequently does experience and benefit from. What is the most difficult task you ever accomplished in your life … a general human
                            task . . . something that every one of us has learned to do? Walking and talking! Just consider that! Did you follow some instruction manual to learn how to stand up and walk when you were around 1 year old? Like, put the right
                            foot out; plant it; reach up with your left hand; push up with your left knee. Or, did you follow a grammar book to learn how to master the language and talk when you were around 2 years old? Who did that for you? You did!
                            But not this conscious, rational thinking mind that always seems to be there now to manage our adult lives. No. Our larger, now mysterious it seems, subconscious selves guided us into walking and talking. And now, when we are
                            not completely acting out of our subconscious as we were when we were children, we can again reach that comprehensive experience and turn it to our constant advantage. We can offer our subconscious suggestions, reinforce goals,
                            direct habits, encourage ourselves. We can welcome back the subconscious, that great fount of energy and wisdom that nurtured us as children, and still does.</p>
                        <p>What does our subconscious do; what do we continually do for ourselves hypnotically? Our subconscious instinctively causes our heart to beat; our life blood to course through our body; our lungs to exchange our air with the outside
                            world; stimulates our digestive system to transform our food into nutrients; and, our subconscious maintains our life and identity through sleeping to wakening. Do you wake up not knowing who you are, having lost your identity?
                            No! Who … or what … keeps track of those things in your life? You do, hypnotically, instinctively, by means of your all-knowing subconscious, the part of you that is limitless in scope and power.</p>
                        <p>Yes, that larger part of us that is below, around, and throughout us, our subconscious, is essentially working for us out of the various levels of the hypnotic state. A perfect example of this is when you’re driving a car on the
                            highway and all of a sudden you realize 5 minutes and 5 miles or 15 minutes and 15 miles or more flew by you unnoticed by your conscious mind. You are in and out of the hypnotic state continually.</p>
                        <p>What I do as a hypnotist is to guide you to the hypnotic state in the most relaxed and natural manner and then make the suggestions - which you have come up with yourself and offered to me - directly to that newly re-opened part
                            of you, your subconscious, so you can change some habits or access new information so as to further develop and enhance your life. Now remember one of those definitions - that all hypnosis is self-hypnosis. One of the key elements
                            of hypnosis is teaching you to hypnotize yourself, empowering you to help yourself to this great resource. And, hypnotizing yourself is really what’s happening in that relationship with the hypnotist, with me. You simply allow
                            me, invite my voice, to be there for you. And when you leave the office, you can revisit that hypnotic state of your subconscious at your will and pleasure.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-header">Anthroposophy</h4>
                        <p>Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe.  So it was described by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) as he founded and developed it on the basis of European idealistic philosophy rooted in the philosophies of Aristotle, Plato, and Thomas Aquinas.  Anthroposophy is primarily defined by its method of research, and secondly by the possible knowledge or experiences this leads to.</p>
                        <p>
                        In his early works, such as The Philosophy of  Freedom, Steiner sought to overcome what he perceived as the dualism of Cartesian idealism and Kantian subjectivism by developing Goethe's conception of an imaginative power capable of synthesizing the sense-perceptible form of a thing (an image of its outer appearance) and the concept we have of that thing (an image of its inner structure or nature).  Steiner added to this the conception that a further step in the development of thinking is possible when the thinker observes his or her own thought processes.  He described it this way:  "The organ of observation and the observed thought process are then identical, so that the condition thus arrived at is simultaneously one of perception through thinking and one of thought through perception."</p>
                        <p>Thus, in Steiner's view, we can overcome the subject-object divide through inner activity, even though all human experience begins by being conditioned by it.  He characterized the thoughts that he considers without sensory content, such as mathematical or logical thoughts, as free deeds.  Thus he believed he had located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.  Steiner was one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split in Western thought.
                        From this perspective, Anthroposophy can also be called Spiritual Science.  As such, it is an effort to develop not only natural scientific research but also spiritual scientific research on the basis of the idealistic tradition and the historical strivings that have led to the development of modern science. </p>
                        <p>
                        On this basis, Anthroposophy strives to bridge the clefts that have developed since the Middle Ages among science, art and religion, and seeks to unite these strivings of man, these three main areas of human culture, and build the foundation for a synthesis of them for the future.
                        Anthroposophy postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible spiritual world accessible to direct experience through inner development.  More specifically, it aims to develop faculties of perceptive imagination, inspiration and intuition through cultivating a form of thinking independent of sensory experience by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline.</p>
                        <p>Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline; the most complete exposition of these is found in his book How To Know Higher Worlds. The aim of these exercises is to develop higher levels of consciousness through meditation and observation. Details about the spiritual world, Steiner suggested, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, though no more infallibly than the results of natural science. 	In its investigations of the spiritual world, Anthroposophy aims to attain the precision and clarity attained by the natural sciences in their investigations of the physical world and to present the results thus derived in a manner subject to rational verification.
                        Anthroposophical ideas have been applied practically in many areas including Steiner/Waldorf education, special education (most prominently through the Camphill Movement), agriculture, medicine, ethical banking, organizational and social development, and the arts (waldorfanswers.org, anthroposophy.org).</p>
                        <p>
                        For over forty years I have pursued studies and spiritual exercises in Anthroposophy, known also as Spiritual Science, and have had meetings and conversations with that discipline’s scientists, priests, and authors.  This effort has created and sustained for me a lively curiosity for all people and things and the desire to engage with others in the most helpful and productive ways.</p>
