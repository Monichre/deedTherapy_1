                              <p>Mark Wildermann has over twenty years of experience in the educational field (mostly at the college level in both student development and academic departments) and is well grounded in life experience.  At the age of seventeen, he dropped out of college after three days to work on a freighter; returning to school he was baffled in his freshman year by the introductory psychology course which presented in all seriousness behaviorism as explanation of the human being;  several years later he visited the Bollingen Tower in Switzerland of the founder of analytical psychology Carl Jung; graduating with a B.A. in English he wrote plays and screenplays while working as a baker and truck driver among other things.    He earned an M.Ed. in Mental Health which is balanced by training and practice in several alternative healing modalities:  Transcendental Meditation, Anthroposophy, Reiki Master Teacher, Past Life Regression Therapist, Bach Flower Therapist, and Nationally Certified Hypnotherapist.  I have worked with the most diverse individuals and groups at all stages of personal development.  The unceasing rewards and challenges of those relationships have taught me to adapt techniques and treatments for the unique situation that’s always presented.  No stone left unturned.  No client left unrecognized. </p>

                              <p> My pursuits of somewhat other realities began in my early 20s with Transcendental Meditation and Anthroposophy (also known as Spiritual Science, as developed by Rudolf Steiner.The Reiki and Bach Flower experiences provided the practical application of healing/transformation techniques to help others.The Masters in Mental Health Counseling focused and honed my relational and interviewing skills, but it also essentially confirmed for me what not to do – diagnose and label people.  The scientific model systemically entrenched in our culture understandably satisfies the human drive to understand through naming and categorizing; but, that perspective can, and indeed has, set severe limits upon human experience, interfering with and short-circuiting processes of growth, decay, and change so that we forgot we’re invited to, in fact, we must, participate in actively. Hypnotism reminded me that all healing/transformation is self-healing (all hypnosis is self-hypnosis) and the practitioner is a witness, at best a facilitator. I understand it to be our human destiny to evolve a spiritualization of substance and, by acknowledging that the matter of our personal business exists by the grace of the universal, we activate our destiny through a self-willed becoming indeed..</p>
